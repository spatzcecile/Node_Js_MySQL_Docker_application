# Node_Js_MySQL_Docker_application

You are to create a dockerized web application using nodejs for the backend, and a MySQL server as the database. You should use docker compose for the application building.   Your final deliverable should be a link to your github directory containing the finished code.

## Run
```
docker-compose up
```
This will start 2 dockerized container mysql and nodejs. 
The database is about football players.

**nodejs container** will connect to **mysql** running inside the container.
